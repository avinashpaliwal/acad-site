I am a PhD Student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, advised by [Dr. Nima Kalantari](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/nimak). My primary research interests are in Computational Photography, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My current research work is focused on video enhancement techniques like frame interpolation and denoising.
